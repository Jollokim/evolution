# Genetic algorithm
This repository contains an evolution inspired algorithm for turning random bit strings into bit strings containing only 1s.
The repository is a part of a graded school project at Ã˜stfold University College in Machine Learning.

In our report we describe experiments, the notebooks with the described statistics and plots can be found in experiment1, experiment2 and other_notebooks folder. These are not supposed to be run, but will have the statistics and plots saved in them as when we ran the experiments the first time.

The algorithm is fully parameterized and we have different options for selection and mutation schemes.

We primarily use Jupyter notebooks to run the algorithm as its also used as a place to save our plots and statistics. However, it is also possible to just run main.py.

Use run_evolution.ipynb, if you want to test the algorithm yourself. The notebook will explain in each cell what you need to do, and will yield statistics and plots for the run.
